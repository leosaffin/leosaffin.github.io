I am a postdoc at the University of Reading.
My research interests are focused on the dynamics of the atmosphere, how it is affected by small-scale and diabatic processes, and how these processes are represented in models.
My current work is investigating the interaction between tropical-origin cyclones and midlatitude dynamics

I have previously worked on:
- Eddy feedbacks in climate models and the connection to the signal-to-noise paradox
- The dynamics of trade-wind cumulus clouds and their representation in kilometre-scale and convection-parametrizing models
- Reduced-precision computing for parametrizations
- The influences of diabatic processes on large-scale dynamics in the midlatitudes and their relation to forecast errors

See the projects page for more details.
